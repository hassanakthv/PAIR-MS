# isoms
*Orbitrap IsoR MS data processing library*

## In order to measure the isotopic ratio of each elements (CHNO) in a given sample, you need to convert the .raw files to .mzML file using a converter software such as MSConvertGUI. In the routine platform the isotopic ratio will be determined in MS/MS scans with HCD 50. To convert the file from routine platform one should add HCD and MS 2 as filters before convert the .raw to .mzML .

## To have a nice information about the samples and experiment, you should provide a .csv file with the name of the samples.
